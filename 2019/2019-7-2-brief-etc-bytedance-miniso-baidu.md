航通社将每日呈现一份关于中国互联网的双语简报，下面的内容将以中英文同时提供。

Our staff at lishuhang.me will show you a bilingual brief about Chinese tech section's latest developments every day. The following contents will be provided by both Chinese and English.

## ETC

中国两大靠前的电子支付平台，支付宝和微信支付，在同一天宣布支持车主申领 ETC，也就是可以在高速公路收费站自动扣款，无需停车付款的设备。

Both of the leading payment platforms in China - Alipay and WeChat pay announced support of applying ETC cards and devices. ETC automatically finished highway toll payments and helping cars crossing toll stations directly without any stop. 

支付宝与中国邮政储蓄银行合作开展免费申领 ETC 的活动。车主申领时先交押金，激活后押金退还，可以免费获得卡和设备。微信则是通过 50 多个第三方小程序来实现办卡，各个服务商的优惠政策不同。

Alipay launched a campaign with China Postal Savings Bank to send ETC cards and devices as a free gift. The only thing car owners need to do is pay the deposit, which would be returned after activated the ETC. WeChat ETC application went available via 50+ 3rd-party mini programs, while their policies varied.

有证券公司统计，到年底如果要实现国内汽车安装 ETC 的数量超过90%的话，那么意味着将会有 1.4 亿辆汽车，在今年之内安装 ETC。除了支付平台之外，全国有多个发卡银行也在推行倒贴钱送 ETC 的计划。有分析人士认为这将会激活信用卡的使用频率，以及修车保养等汽车后服务市场。

Statistics from securities firms showed around 140 million cars need to install ETC within the year to meet the goal of a 90% domestic ETC acceptance rate. Besides payment platforms, several Chinese banks with credit card services also provide free ETC installation campaigns. Analysis suggested this will increase the frequency of bank card usage and after-sales service market such as car repair and maintenance.

## 百度无人车 Baidu Self-driving Cars

北京为百度的自动驾驶车辆颁发了首批 T4 级别的测试牌照，这是目前全国技术等级最高，测试场景最难的开放道路自动驾驶牌照。

Beijing government has granted the first batch of T4 test licenses for Baidu's self-driving vehicles. This is the nation's top open road auto-driving license with the highest technical level and the most difficult test scenario.

申请 T4 牌照要求汽车能穿过隧道、学校等区域，应对行人违法通行，施工路段绕行等复杂场景，识别潮汐车道，路口左弯待转、临时红绿灯等特殊的交通标志，还要具备超车、坡道起步、停车入库、侧方停车等能力。

To apply for a T4 license, the cars must pass through areas like tunnels and schools, deal with complicated scenes and signs such as rushing pedestrians, construction roadblocks, tidal lanes, left-turn waiting zones, temporary traffic lights. Abilities such as ramp start, reverse parking and side parking are also required.

获得这一牌照车辆需要进行不少于 5000 公里的测试，并一次性通过 102 项场景覆盖测试。百度目前在北京拥有 45 辆测试车，总测试里程接近 14 万公里，是北京所有厂家自动驾驶测试路程之和的 91%。

Vehicles that receive this license are required to perform tests of no less than 5,000 kilometers and pass 102 scenario tests at one time. Baidu currently has 45 test vehicles in Beijing, with a total test mileage of nearly 140,000 kilometers, which is 91% of the sum of all manufacturers' test mileage in this city.

搭载百度上一代阿波罗技术的车辆，在旧金山湾区等美国城市开展测试。2019年，沃尔沃和福特帮助阿波罗在中国道路上展开测试。阿波罗的合作伙伴还有奇瑞，比亚迪，长城，现代，起亚，福特等。
