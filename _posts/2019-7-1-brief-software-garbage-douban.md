## 软件产业 Software industry

中国工业和信息化部介绍，2019年1~5月份，中国软件产业实现业务收入2.63万亿元，同比增长14.7%。2018年全年这个数字是6.3万亿元，同比增长14.2%。

MIIT, a Chinese government division said that in the first 5 months of 2019, China's software industry has achieved a total of 2.63 trillion Yuan of revenue, increased 14.7% year-on-year. The revenue of the full year 2018 was 6.3 trillion yuan with a 14.2% increase yoy.

两天前工信部部长苗圩在第23届中国国际软件博览会的开幕式上指出，接下来要重点做好的工作，是强化软件定义在工业互联网大数据人工智能，智能网联汽车等新兴领域的推广，建立健全软件工程软件评测软件质量保障等第三方服务体系，持续加大知识产权保护力度，以及围绕一带一路建设推进软件领域的国际交流。

Two days ago Miao Wei 苗圩, the minister of MIIT spoke at the opening ceremony of the 23rd Chinese International Software Exposition that the country's following job will be focused on several points: To strengthen the definition of software at newly born fields like the industrial Internet, big data, AI, Connected cars; Establish and improve 3rd party services like software engineering, testing and quality protection; Enhance IPR protection; Push international software cooperation to share the advantages of the Belt and Road Initiative.

近期一系列事件体现出中国部分软件产品，在核心技术上与世界先进水平的差距，例如华为的芯片设计软件是依赖外国的产品进口的，在中国没有对应的产品销售。对此，苗圩也指出未来要重点培养软件核心技术和龙头企业。

Recently, some events showed the drawback on software technologies in China. For example, Huawei have to import chip developing software since there is no efficient domestic alternatives. Miao also stressed the importance of nurturing core software technologies and leading enterprises in future.

## 垃圾分类 Garbage classification

上海在全国大城市中首个全面推行垃圾分类政策。有消息传出，北京等大城市也将陆续实施同样的政策。史上最严的分类要求和处罚措施让人们很不习惯，因此一些设备与服务引入市场，来满足人们的突然需求。

Shanghai became the first major Chinese city that fully applied Garbage Classification policies. Message shows such policies will soon be promoted to other mega cities including Beijing. The most strict rules and penalties in history making people very uncomfortable. Some devices and services are introduced into the Chinese market to meet people's sudden needs.

其中一个是在北美地区，可能已经很熟悉的厨房垃圾处理器，它们把食物残渣和厨余垃圾打碎之后冲入下水道。国内媒体给出评测指南，考察厨房垃圾处理器的主要指标是它的功率及容量（越大越好）。

One of them is Kitchen waste processor, which may familiar to North American homes. This machine can break up all the leftover foods and wastes into fluids then rush them into the sewer. Chinese website providing detailed reviews introducing the key properties, such as power and capacity (bigger is better).

在淘宝上，关于垃圾桶的产品，有多达几十页的产品被打上了上海垃圾分类等关键字。有网店负责人表示6月份销量是过去的10~20倍。

In Taobao, the biggest online market in China, a search of dustbins leads to dozens of pages of products that added keywords "Shanghai" and "garbage classification". One shop manager said to Chinese media they sold 10 to 20 times more dustbins than usual in the entire June.

## 豆瓣 FM Douban FM

在中国类似潘多拉的音乐服务豆瓣 FM 宣布推出了一个新的移动版本，成为其被数字音乐版权平台 VFine Music 收购的标志。收购之前的 2 月，豆瓣 FM 获得腾讯音乐等的战略投资。

Douban FM, a Chinese music service like Pandora announced a new version of its mobile apps. It is a sign of their recent change - being acquired by VFine Music, a digital music copyright platform. Before the acquisition, Double FM gained strategic venture from TME, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and others this February.

新的收购方承诺，对豆瓣 FM 过去 10 年来所积累的用户信息予以保留。但是不得不剥离这一服务，对于豆瓣这个以图书和电影评论起家的网站而言，是搞多元化经营并不成功的体现。

Their new parent company promised to keep the user message that Douban FM accumulated in the past 10 years. However, stripping music streaming service itself already reflected Douban's failure at diversified development, after its bootstrap of collecting book and movie reviews.

豆瓣在中国是一个非常具有传奇性和反规律的互联网产品，上线10多年来一直处于比较慢的发展状态，却没有因此而被快节奏的其他巨头打败。有很多分析指出，豆瓣原本有机会获得更大的发展，例如在进入移动互联网时代时的一个决策错误。他们认为用户可能需要将网站的每一个板块都做成一个独立的APP，最后的趋势却是人们喜欢所有功能都放在一起的大的APP。当豆瓣知道这个错误并改正的时候，已经过去了三四年时间。

As a legendary and unconventional internet product in China, Douban keeps its slow pace in over a decade while never be defeated by other speedy expanded giants. There are some analysis pointed out Douban missed several opportunities to go big, such as a bad decision they've made in the dawn of mobile internet era. They supposed user wanted to separate each sections of its whole website into individual apps, but the trend turned out to be on the contrary: people like huge all-in-one APP that puts all the functions together. When Douban acknowledged this mistake and try to fix it, 3-4 years has passed.

不过豆瓣是一个相对比较公平和专业的图书，电影等产品的评论社区。相对于 IMDB、烂番茄等国外同类产品，在中国豆瓣面对的环境更差，包括网民数量更多而出现骚扰者，而较不发达的电影产业导致花钱购买正面评论的现象。要想保持公允的评价环境，对豆瓣来说永远是艰难的。

But Douban managed to be a relatively fair and professional comment community. Compared to overseas conterparts like IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes, Douban faces a worse condition in China. More netizens brought serious trolling problems. Less developed film industry lead to paid positive comments. It is always hard for Douban to keep its fair and balanced environment.
