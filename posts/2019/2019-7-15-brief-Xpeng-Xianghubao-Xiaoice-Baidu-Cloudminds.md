## Xpeng Electric Cars In Trouble

电动汽车生产商小鹏遭遇了全国多地车主维权，主要原因是在他们因降价促销购买了旧款的小鹏汽车之后不久，就发现小鹏推出了新款汽车，不仅参数全面提升，售价还比原来的低。虽然小鹏汽车董事长何小鹏向车主致歉，提出为三年内换购新车的老车主提供 1 万元补贴，但是车主们并不接受。此外，拍下巴菲特午餐的比特币从业者孙雨晨也说将拿出 1000 万元支持车主维权。

Electric car manufacturer Xpeng suffered from demonstrations of its customers across the nation. After Xpeng car buyers attracted by the company's campaign and purchased the current models, they found that Xpeng soon launched new models, which not only improved the parameters, but also cut the price.  Although Xpeng's Chairman He Xiaopeng apologized and proposed to provide 10,000 yuan coupon for people who bought its products within 3 years, the car owners did not accept it. In addition, Sun Yuchen, a bitcoin practitioner who auctioned the "Warren Buffett's lunch", said that he would pay 10 million yuan to support the car owners' struggle.

## Xianghubao: Ant Financial's Mutual-Aid Product

7月的第一个星期，多家媒体报道了蚂蚁金服的大病互助金融产品“相互宝”的最新进展。从去年 10 月上线到今天，相互宝运行将满 8 个月，用户总数即将到达 8000 万，人均分摊金额将突破 1 元，单期资助接近 300 例。相互宝用户有 44% 位于一、二线城市，另有 32% 位于农村、县城。它为草根用户提供了低门槛的大病保障，也给他们普及了保险意识。据官方介绍，相互宝从保险的“保”改名为支付宝的“宝”，对于普通用户而言并无感知，然而实际上却是将当时的 2000 万用户一次性过渡到一个全新的产品上。这在蚂蚁金服历史上还是首次，也是他们面临的第一个重大挑战。

In the first week of July, several media report published to reflect the latest developments in Ant Financial’s mutual-aid financial product “Xianghubao”. Since last October, Xianghubao run for almost 8 months. Its user amount will reach 80 million very soon, with a shared expense per capita of about 1 yuan, and 300 claims during one single phase. 44% of Xianghubao's users are located in first- and second-tier cities, and another 32% in small towns and rural areas. It provides "grassroots" users a low threshold protection for serious illness, cultivated their insurance awareness. Xianghubao shared their first major challenge in history: change its name from 保 (insurance) to 宝 (suffix similar to Alipay 支付宝). The change may hardly awared by common users since its prononciation in Chinese didn't change, but it's actually a one-time transition to a brand new product for 20 million users at that time, which is also unprecedented for the whole Ant Financial team.

## Baidu Fell Into Fake News Dispute (Again)

杭州 9 岁女孩张子欣被租房客人带走并杀害。在案件最终查明之前，搜索引擎百度的新闻板块向用户推送了一条简短的声明，并声称是张子欣爸爸写的。但张子欣的家人否认。百度一开始说确实能证明是真的，但随后又改口说是编辑擅自作假，处理结果是删除文章，开除值班编辑。百度新闻的负责人陈磊也在朋友圈向就此事道歉，说这是自己的管理责任。不过道歉没有换来舆论的原谅，百度继续因为其提供的各种虚假信息而受到批评。稍早前，百度在国家会议中心举行人工智能论坛，CEO 李彦宏被一名来自其故乡的男子泼水以示抗议。

Zhang Zixin, a 9-year-old girl from Hangzhou, was taken away by her parents' home renter and killed. Before the fact was totally revealed, search engine Baidu’s news section pushed a short statement to its user and claimed that it was written by Zhang’s father. But the Zhang family denied. Baidu firstly insisted the content's authenticity, but then made correction that it's a fake news created by its news editor on duty, who was soon been fired. Chen Lei, the person in charge of Baidu News, also apologized in his WeChat Moments, saying the management responsibility went to himself. However, public can't easily forgive. Baidu continued to be criticized for false information it provided. Earlier, Baidu CEO Li Yanhong was splashed water from a man come fron his hometown, during Baidu's annual AI event held at the National Convention Center in Beijing.
